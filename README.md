# Challenge 13, Earthquake Maps

## Project Overview
We'll represent the earthquacke info in several tectonic plates using GeoJson data in a Github repo. 

The goals of this challenge are to:

1. Use d3.json() to get the GeoJson data and add the data using the L.geoJSON() layer.
2. Style the LineString and point data to stand out on the map.
3. Add two sets of data as an overlay with the earthquake data.
4. Add a three basemap style to allow the user to select from three different maps.


## Resources
- Software: VS Code (writing JavaScript)

# Summary
In this module, we will use the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. Each earthquake will be visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. In addition, each earthquake will have a popup marker that, when clicked, will show the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake. Also, we added the tectonic plate data as an additional layer to the existing map.
